## About (Origins)
The organizational unit "swkWien" was previously called "Coding Dojo Vienna". It was created in late 2013/early 2014 because there simply was no such thing before. The mission statement: **Have a programming-language agnostic coding dojo every two weeks in Vienna, with changing hosts and moderators.** This was in line with the already existing Softwerkskammer community in the German speaking region, and was focusing on coding dojos exclusively. Yet, the focus on only just coding dojos became a bit narrow, and we've been considered the Viennese representatives for the Softwerkskammer anyway. Add some potential name clashes with "Coder Dojo", we've decided to rename in early 2018.

A coding dojo is a meeting where programmers of any experience level get together and work on small exercises to improve their skills. They code, learn and have fun away from distractions common in regular office-time. A coding dojo provides a safe environment to tackle topics ranging from design over programming to tools and the like.
