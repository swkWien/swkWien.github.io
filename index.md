## About
Coding Dojo Vienna was created in late 2013/early 2014 because there simply was no such thing before. The mission statement: **Have a programming-language agnostic coding dojo every two weeks in Vienna, with changing hosts and moderators.**

A coding dojo is a meeting where programmers of any experience level get together and work on small exercises to improve their skills. They code, learn and have fun away from distractions common in regular office-time. A coding dojo provides a safe environment to tackle topics ranging from design over programming to tools and the like.

## Past Sessions

[This repository](https://github.com/CodingDojoVie/sessions) on GitHub holds the presentations of past sessions. Completed sessions are added as soon as possible.

Use this as a reference to see what was already done.

## How-To

[A dedicated "How-To" page](http://codingdojovie.github.io/how-to/) lists all basic information for participants, hosts, organizers and moderators. If you find yourself in one of these roles, or would like to tell someone about it, this is the starting page.
