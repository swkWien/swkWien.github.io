# Introduction to the Coding Dojo space on gather.town 
Welcome to the Coding Dojo room of Softwerkskammer Wien!

This document will give initial info on how to use gather.town, as well as specifics to this space.

## gather.town basics

* Move your character around using cursor keys, or WASD.
* To pass other people blocking your path. Press and hold ‘G’ while moving. (“ghost” mode)
* In open spaces, when you are close to others, audio and video connection is established. Change the distance with the circles icon in the lower bar.
* The chat on the side has “local” and “global” (click on the chat title to switch). Local chat is only within your vicinity.
* Some objects allow for interaction. In this case, they light up and a popup at the bottom shows what needs to be done to activate it.

Remember: This platform mimics real life interactions. If you move away from a discussion, be aware that the media streams disconnect as well! This takes some time getting used to :)

The concept of vicinity is overridden by the following functions:
* Someone has the spotlight, either set by a moderator, or by walking to a lectern.
* You enter a “private space”. Private spaces connect only people that share the same space.


## About the Coding Dojo room

The top part is the common area. Have a break there, discuss with others, and gather here for retrospectives and announcements.

At the lower left of the room, there are workstation islands for pairing. These are each private spaces.
Please have at most three people at such a workstation, to leave room for a facilitator to join in.

At the lower right of the room, there are areas for larger groups. These are also private spaces.
(Please imagine a large projection of the workstation on the right wall - we were lacking resources for that :) )

If you want a break, at the far lower left corner are some smaller islands, with a few small private spaces.
